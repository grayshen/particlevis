<P>In addition to the primary scene, ParticleVis is capable of loading and rendering two-dimensional sets of data that correspond to frames from the particle data.  This data is rendered in a subwindow as a line-graph.  As the primary particle data plays back, a marker on each subwindow graph will advance to the data point corresponding to the current frame.</P>

<P>To create a subwindow graph, select "Create Graph from File" from the Graph menu.  A toolbar window will appear with the data from the selected file.  You may position this window anywhere you wish.  It is possible to zoom in and out of the graph, using the left and right mouse buttons respectively, to examine regions of the graph in detail.  Closing the window will destroy the graph.  See File Formats for information on the exact format that graphing files must take.</P>
