<P>PVis is capable of saving frames in the Portable Network Graphics file format as well as a straight ASCII file of pixel values.  Choosing Image Saving Options will allow you to pick the directory and filename of saved files and enable/disable the ASCII dump.  If "Save Image Each Frame" is checked, when the simulation advances to the next frame another sequentially numbered frame will be generated.  While this will slow performance, it enables you to create complete sequences of frames that can be assembled into a movie.</P>
<P>To dump the contents of the current screen to a PNG, just click "Save Frame" on the Control dialog (or press the 's' key in the main window).  This will save output files in the current directory, or the location specified in the Image options dialog.  Each frame is sequentially numbered.  If a previous frame of the same name and number exists it will be overwritten.</P>
