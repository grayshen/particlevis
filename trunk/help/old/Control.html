<P>The Control Dialog allows the user to easily navigate and playback the entire range of simulation frames.</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Playback Buttons</B></DT>
<DD>Along the bottom of the control are five VCR-style playback buttons that enable the user to start and stop the simulation, as well and skip frames one-by-one and jump to the beginning or end of the simulation.</DD>
<DT><B>Position Slider</B></DT>
<DD>The Position slider reflects the current frame of the simulation relative to total frames loaded.  By dragging the slider you can skip rapidly to a specific point in the simulation.</DD>
<DT><B>Speed Slider</B></DT>
<DD>The Maximum Speed slider allows the user to control the rate at which frames are rendered during simulation playback.  If the rendering speed is faster than you wish, you can drag the speed slider to the appropriate frames per second setting and the rendering of frames will be restricted to that speed.</DD>
<DT><B>Reverse Play</B></DT>
<DD>Checking Reverse Play will cause the simulation to play back in reverse, decrementing the frame counter instead of increasing it.</DD>
<DT><B>Repeat Play</B></DT>
<DD>With Repeat Play enabled the simulation will automatically rewind itself and loop back to the beginning (or end) or the loaded frameset.</DD>
<DT><B>Mark Particle</B></DT>
<DD>This command prompts the user to select a particle to be marked in the same manner as the Edit->Mark Particle command.  Marked particles are highlighted and their paths over time are drawn.</DD>
<DT><B>Save Frame</B></DT>
<DD>This command will cause the current rendered frame of the simulation to be saved to a png file and, optionally, ascii-dump file.  See the "Saving Image Output" help topic.</DD>
